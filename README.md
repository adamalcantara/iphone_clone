# iPhone 15 Pro Website Clone

## Description
When I first started developing websites, I was fascinated by the pages on Apple's website and their interactivity. The smooth, scroll-based animations made me want to learn those skills.

This project was built as an exercise to learn animations in React. Following a course on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRQbRAJ4-Fs), I learned how to implement animations using GSAP, as well as 3D interactive modeling using Three.js. Tailwind CSS was used here for the animations

### Installation
